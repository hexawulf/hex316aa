## About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at IU, Germany, blending a lifelong love of learning with a deep curiosity about technology. While my path may be unconventional, it's fueled by purpose and passion.

My background is quite diverse:

🎓 M.A. in Classical Chinese – Years of studying Chinese language, literature, and culture have shaped my worldview and deepened my appreciation for tradition and complexity.
💼 Managing Director – With almost 25 years running a China-based import/export business, I bring cross-cultural insight and strategic experience to everything I do.
📚 Lifelong Learner – At 50+, I'm proving it's never too late to reinvent yourself. CS is my newest passion, and I’m diving in headfirst.

## My Interests

💻 Coding – I enjoy the challenge of building things. I'm completely new to coding and currently focused on first-semester Java projects.
📖 Reading – Avid reader across genres, with a particular love for sci-fi.
🧧 Chinese Culture – Passionate about language, history, philosophy, and art.
🤖 AI – Intrigued by how artificial intelligence is shaping the future.
🔬 Computer Science – Eager to learn as much as I can about this ever-evolving field.
